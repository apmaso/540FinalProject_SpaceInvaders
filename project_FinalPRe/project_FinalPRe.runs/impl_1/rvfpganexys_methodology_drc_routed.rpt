TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT clk_gen/swervolfn_0_40673_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.

No common phase between related clocks from parallel MMCMs or PLLs  
The clocks clk_core and clk_31_5_clk_wiz_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel MMCMs or PLLs and at least one of the block's clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all parallel MMCMs or PLLs must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, ddr2/clk, clock_divider/clk_in1

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
